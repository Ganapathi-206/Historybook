                            <h2>PANAKALA SWAMI</h2>
                            <p>Mangalagiri temple is famous for the panakam offering which is a mixture of jaggery water with cardamom and other spices. You will be surprised to see the Deity Who is swayambhu i.e. self-manifested and represented by His lotus mouth merely. Sri Panakala Narasimha Swamy is also known as Sudarshana Narasimha.The temple will be opened till afternoon only, with the belief that devatas will perform pujas in the night. God takes jaggery water as an offering by a conch.</p>

                                    <p>There will be no statue of the god, but there is only a mouth, widely opened to 15 cms. The mouth is covered by the metal face of the god.<span>The Jaggery water is poured into the mouth of the Lord, and Lord Narayana shows that he has fully satisfied himself, when half of water is thrown back as a prasada to the devotees.</span>The hill on which the Temple is constructed is a passive volcano.The mountain itself is in the shape of kneeling elephant as seen from a distance</p>
